Flat-Forms
==========

I'm always getting comps with styled forms so I wanted to create this as a baseline. I have custom styles for text
and password inputs, select boxes, radio buttons and checkboxes and various buttons. I even took a stab at the
date input type, but it only works in a few browsers and doesn't render consistently.
